# Dynamic Knowledge Graph System

## Overview

The MCP now features a comprehensive dynamic knowledge graph system that automatically updates and expands based on new developments across therapeutic areas. This transforms it from a static, hardcoded system to an intelligent, self-learning platform.

## Key Components

### 1. Knowledge Updater (`knowledge-updater.ts`)
**Auto-discovery and real-time monitoring system**

- **Data Sources**: FDA Orange Book, ClinicalTrials.gov, EMA, DrugBank, PubMed, SEC filings, patent databases, pharma news
- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically identifies new drugs from recent clinical trials
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks phase progressions, approvals, discontinuations
- **Company Intelligence**: Monitors SEC filings, patent assignments, licensing deals
- **NLP Mechanism Detection**: Extracts mechanism of action from scientific literature

### 2. ML Drug Classifier (`ml-drug-classifier.ts`)
**Machine learning-based pattern recognition**

- **Drug Classification**: Predicts drug class (monoclonal antibody, small molecule, gene therapy, etc.)
- **Modality Prediction**: Determines modality type (biologic, small molecule, gene therapy, oligonucleotide)
- **Therapeutic Area Prediction**: Infers therapeutic areas from drug names and trial data
- **Competitor Prediction**: Uses embedding similarity to predict competitors
- **Continuous Learning**: Updates models based on new drug discoveries

### 3. Dynamic Configuration Manager (`dynamic-knowledge-config.ts`)
**Adaptive system configuration**

- **Configurable Data Sources**: Enable/disable sources, adjust update frequencies
- **Therapeutic Area Management**: Prioritize areas based on usage patterns
- **Real-time Event Handling**: Process approvals, trial updates, company announcements
- **Adaptive Configuration**: Automatically adjusts priorities based on user queries
- **Scheduler Management**: Manages update frequencies (realtime, daily, weekly, monthly)

### 4. Enhanced Knowledge Graph (`drug-knowledge-graph.ts`)
**Core knowledge management with dynamic capabilities**

- **Dynamic Updates**: Add/update drugs, indications, competitive mappings in real-time
- **Data Validation**: Quality checks for new drug data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Merge data from multiple sources with confidence scoring
- **Event Hooks**: Real-time callbacks for drug additions, competitor relationships
- **Analytics**: Knowledge graph coverage statistics and insights

```

## Update Mechanisms

### 1. Scheduled Updates
- **Daily**: ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA approvals, PubMed, SEC filings
- **Weekly**: FDA Orange Book, patent databases
- **Monthly**: DrugBank comprehensive updates
- **Real-time**: Pharma news, regulatory announcements

### 2. Event-Driven Updates
- **New Approvals**: Immediate competitive landscape recalculation
- **Phase Changes**: Update trial status and competitive threat assessment
- **Company Announcements**: Update partnership and development status
- **Patent Filings**: Track intellectual property changes

### 3. ML-Driven Discovery
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify new drug naming patterns
- **Similarity Clustering**: Group similar drugs for competitive analysis
- **Therapeutic Area Expansion**: Discover emerging therapeutic areas
- **Mechanism Detection**: Extract mechanism of action from literature

## Flexibility Features

### 1. Configurable Data Sources
```typescript
// Enable/disable sources dynamically
await dynamicKnowledgeManager.updateDataSourceConfig('drugbank', {
  enabled: true,
  updateFrequency: 'weekly',
  priority: 8
});
```

### 2. Adaptive Therapeutic Areas
```typescript
// Auto-enable emerging therapeutic areas
await dynamicKnowledgeManager.enableTherapeuticArea('gene_therapy', {
  priority: 8,
  autoDiscovery: true,
  competitorThreshold: 0.6
});
```

### 3. ML Threshold Adjustment
```typescript
// Adjust confidence thresholds based on performance
await dynamicKnowledgeManager.updateMLThresholds({
  drugClassification: 0.8,
  competitorPrediction: 0.7
});
```

## Real-Time Intelligence

### 1. Live Competitive Landscape
- Automatic competitor discovery from clinical trial data
- Real-time phase progression tracking
- Immediate approval impact assessment

### 2. Market Movement Detection
- New drug entries in therapeutic areas
- Company strategy changes from SEC filings
- Patent landscape shifts

### 3. Predictive Analytics
- Competitor threat assessment based on trial phases
- Market timing predictions from development timelines
- Strategic partnership recommendations

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Confidence Scoring
- All updates include confidence scores (0-1)
- High-confidence threshold (>0.7) for automatic updates
- Manual review queue for medium-confidence updates

### 2. Data Validation
- Required fields validation for new drugs
- Cross-source verification
- Conflict resolution with source prioritization

### 3. Audit Trail
- Complete update history with sources and confidence
- Rollback capabilities for incorrect updates
- Performance monitoring and alerting

## Usage Examples

### Auto-Update from Clinical Trials
```typescript
// Discover new immunology drugs from recent trials
const newDrugs = await knowledgeUpdater.discoverNewDrugs();
await drugKnowledgeGraph.updateFromExternalSource('clinicaltrials_gov', newDrugs);
```

### ML-Powered Drug Analysis
```typescript
// Classify unknown drug
const prediction = await mlDrugClassifier.predictDrugProperties('teplizumab', {
  trialData: trials,
  sponsorInfo: { name: 'Provention Bio' }
});
// Result: { drugClass: 'monoclonal_antibody', therapeuticArea: 'immunology', competitors: [...] }
```

### Real-Time Event Processing
```typescript
// Process FDA approval
await dynamicKnowledgeManager.handleRealTimeEvent({
  type: 'new_approval',
  data: { drug: 'lecanemab', indication: 'alzheimers' },
  source: 'fda_news',
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```
